The genus Ophiophagus was proposed by GÃ¼nther in 1864 in place of Hamadryas, as the genus Hamadryas was already used for the cracker butterflies.[6] The name is derived from its propensity to eat snakes.[7] Ophiophagus hannah was accepted as the valid name for the king cobra by Charles Mitchill Bogert in 1945 who argued that it differs significantly from Naja species.[8]

It has been suggested that three more king cobra species exist in addition to O. hannah, namely the Sunda king cobra O. bungarus, the Western Ghats king cobra (O. kaalinga) and the Luzon king cobra (O. salvatana). These distinct genetic lineages are geographically isolated and adapted to specific ecological regions.
